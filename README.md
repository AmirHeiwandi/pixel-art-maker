#### Descripton
This is the third and final project in the nanoodegree program "Introduction to programming". 
The main goal of the project is using the newly learned Javascript skill. With Javascript, you're supposed to program that the value of height and width makes and table when submitting.
Clicking on the cells should paint the cell, by changing the background color. The color would be the chosen coler in the color-picker.
When there is an existing table, clicking the "Submit" button, a new table of the new values is made and all of the previous painted cells are removed.
